// Time Complexity: O(n)
// Space Complexity: O(n)

//"Can you improve space complexity?"
//Yes, but only with a brute-force solution using nested loops. 
// It would reduce space to O(1) but time complexity becomes O(nÂ²), which is not ideal.

//If sorted or nested loops are used, the time complexity would be O(n log n) or O(n^2).
